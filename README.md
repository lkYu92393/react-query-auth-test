# react-query-auth-test

An react app I create to help me understand the flow of react-query-auth

# How to run

Clone this repo and run `npm install`. Also clone the nodejs_db to act as data server (link: https://github.com/lkYu92393/nodejs_db).

When running locally, this react app will use port 3000 while the db server use port 5000. Using the proxy builtin in react, it can access port 5000 without CORS.
